// Color tokens for the WaitQR dashboard. Keeping this as a plain object (rather than CSS
// variables) lets components pass colors directly into inline styles and SVG props, which is
// used heavily throughout (e.g. <FillBorder color={C.amber} />). If this grows, it's a natural
// seam to convert into CSS custom properties or a Tailwind theme extension.
